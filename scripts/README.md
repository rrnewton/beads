# Beads Scripts

Utility scripts for maintaining the beads project.

## release.sh (‚≠ê The Easy Button)

**One-command release** from version bump to local installation.

### Usage

```bash
# Full release (does everything)
./scripts/release.sh 0.9.3

# Preview what would happen
./scripts/release.sh 0.9.3 --dry-run
```

### What It Does

This master script automates the **entire release process**:

1. ‚úÖ Kills running daemons (avoids version conflicts)
2. ‚úÖ Runs tests and linting
3. ‚úÖ Bumps version in all files
4. ‚úÖ Commits and pushes version bump
5. ‚úÖ Creates and pushes git tag
6. ‚úÖ Updates Homebrew formula
7. ‚úÖ Upgrades local brew installation
8. ‚úÖ Verifies everything works

**After this script completes, your system is running the new version!**

### Examples

```bash
# Release version 0.9.3
./scripts/release.sh 0.9.3

# Preview a release (no changes made)
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0 --dry-run
```

### Prerequisites

- Clean git working directory
- All changes committed
- golangci-lint installed
- Homebrew installed (for local upgrade)
- Push access to steveyegge/beads and steveyegge/homebrew-beads

### Output

The script provides colorful, step-by-step progress output:
- üü® Yellow: Current step
- üü© Green: Step completed
- üü• Red: Errors
- üü¶ Blue: Section headers

### What Happens Next

After the script finishes:
- GitHub Actions builds binaries for all platforms (~5 minutes)
- PyPI package is published automatically
- Users can `brew upgrade bd` to get the new version
- GitHub Release is created with binaries and changelog

## bump-version.sh

Bumps the version number across all beads components in a single command.

### Usage

```bash
# Show usage
./scripts/bump-version.sh

# Update versions (shows diff, no commit)
./scripts/bump-version.sh 0.9.3

# Update versions and auto-commit
./scripts/bump-version.sh 0.9.3 --commit
```

### What It Does

Updates version in all these files:
- `cmd/bd/version.go` - bd CLI version constant
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Plugin version
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` - Marketplace plugin version
- `integrations/beads-mcp/pyproject.toml` - MCP server version
- `README.md` - Alpha status version
- `PLUGIN.md` - Version requirements

### Features

- **Validates** semantic versioning format (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Verifies** all versions match after update
- **Shows** git diff of changes
- **Auto-commits** with standardized message (optional)
- **Cross-platform** compatible (macOS and Linux)

### Examples

```bash
# Bump to 0.9.3 and review changes
./scripts/bump-version.sh 0.9.3
# Review the diff, then manually commit

# Bump to 1.0.0 and auto-commit
./scripts/bump-version.sh 1.0.0 --commit
git push origin main
```

### Why This Script Exists

Previously, version bumps only updated `cmd/bd/version.go`, leaving other components out of sync. This script ensures all version numbers stay consistent across the project.

### Safety

- Checks for uncommitted changes before proceeding
- Refuses to auto-commit if there are existing uncommitted changes
- Validates version format before making any changes
- Verifies all versions match after update
- Shows diff for review before commit

## Future Scripts

Additional maintenance scripts may be added here as needed.
